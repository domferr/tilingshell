You are on a mission to **make Linux window management better for everyone**!

### Tiling System ###
When grabbing and moving a window, press <kbd>CTRL</kbd> key to show the tiling layout (you can choose another key from the preferences). When moving on a tile, it will highlight. Ungrab the window to place that window on the highlighted tile.

[tiling_system.webm](https://github.com/domferr/tilingshell/assets/14203981/a45ec416-ad39-458d-9b9f-cddce8b25666)

> This extension and the tiling system also implements Windows PowerToys FancyZones!

<p align="right"><b>Go to Usage</b> <a href="#usage">⬆️</a></p>

### Snap Assistant ###
When grabbing and moving a window, the snap assistant will be available on top of the screen. Move the window near it to activate the snap assistant. While still grabbing the window, move your mouse to the tile you are interested in. By stopping grabbing the window will be tiled to the selected tile!

[snap_assistant.webm](https://github.com/domferr/tilingshell/assets/14203981/33511582-fa92-445e-b1ba-8b08f9a8e43a)

> Snap Assistant's sensibility can be customized from the preferences.

<p align="right"><b>Go to Usage</b> <a href="#usage">⬆️</a></p>

### Select a layout ###
Click on Tiling Shell's panel indicator and the available layouts will be shown. Select the one you prefer by clicking on it. That layout will be applied to every monitor in case you have more than one.

[layout_selection.webm](https://github.com/domferr/tilingshell/assets/14203981/f4956a34-64e3-4c24-b177-8f9b08fcc45c)


<p align="right"><b>Go to Usage</b> <a href="#usage">⬆️</a></p>

### Select multiple tiles ###

The layout is not strict. You can select multiple tiles too! Just hold <kbd>ALT</kbd> while using the tiling system (you can choose another key from the preferences).

[multiple_selection.webm](https://github.com/domferr/tilingshell/assets/14203981/92b29130-260c-479d-9237-bf5c87427e52)

<p align="right"><b>Go to Usage</b> <a href="#usage">⬆️</a></p>

### Tiling Buttons ###

Right-click on a window to use the auto-tile buttons and the snap assistant from there! The auto-tile buttons allow you to tile to the leftmost or rightmost empty tile, based on your selected layout. The "Move to best tile" button suggests tiling to the nearest empty tile to the center of the screen.

<p align="right"><b>Go to Usage</b> <a href="#usage">⬆️</a></p>

### Auto-tiling ###

When a window is created, it is automatically moved to the best tile according to where other windows are tiled and the current layout. This is disabled by default and can be enabled in the preferences.

[automatic_tiling](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76abc53f-2c6d-47ab-bee3-bbcdd946f2a1)

### Export and import layouts ###

*Tiling Shell* supports importing and exporting its layouts to a JSON file. With this you can create your own custom layouts without the built-in graphical editor, or share your layouts with others! If you are interested into knowing more about the contents of the layout file check the official [documentation](./doc/json-internal-documentation.md).


<p align="right"><b>Go to Usage</b> <a href="#usage">⬆️</a></p>

### Tiling context menu ###

Right-click on a window to use the auto-tile buttons and the snap assistant from there! These buttons allow you to tile to the leftmost or rightmost empty tile, based on your selected layout. The "Move to best tile" button suggests tiling to the nearest empty tile to the center of the screen.

> The original idea was to show the snap assistant when hovering the maximize button (as it is done on Windows 11). Unfortunately, GNOME doesn't let us handle the hovering of the maximize button or add another button near it...

<p align="right"><b>Go to Usage</b> <a href="#usage">⬆️</a></p>

### Smart border radius ###

In GNOME, different windows may have different border radius. Drawing a border around the focused window is hard because it is not possible to know the window border radius. All the existing extensions just draw a border with a static value, making the UI less polished. Tiling Shell, **dynamically** computes the focused window border radius at runtime. Moreover, if you have an extension or anything else who customize the border radius, the focused window border radius adapts as well! This can be enabled/disabled from the extension's preferences too.

</p>

<p align="right"><b>Go to Usage</b> <a href="#usage">⬆️</a></p>

### Windows Suggestions ###

After placing a window in a tile using the tiling system, snap assistant or active screen edges, you’ll see suggestions for other windows to fill the remaining tiles. Got too many windows open? No problem! If all suggestions don’t fit within the available space, you’ll get a **scrollable list** for quick and easy navigation. See it in action:

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fbf68458-199d-490b-90cf-3e976d5b511b

_Can I choose to opt in or out?_

Yes. From the extension's preferences you find a section called Windows Suggestions. You can enable and disable windows suggestions for tiling system, snap assistant and screen edges. You can choose which of the three to keep enabled, or all of them, to personalize for your needs and preferences.

### How to add new keybindings

1. Edit the file `resources/schemas/org.gnome.shell.extensions.tilingshell.gschema.xml` and add a new key with a name, default empty value and a summary. For example, add the following if the name is `highlight-current-window` and the summary is `Minimize all the other windows and show only the focused window`:
```xml
<key type="as" name="highlight-current-window">
  <default><![CDATA[['']]]></default>
  <summary>Minimize all the other windows and show only the focused window</summary>
</key>
```

2. Edit the file `src/settings/settings.ts` and add a static constant at the end of the list of the static constants (for example [here](https://github.com/domferr/tilingshell/blob/8a1f21620d5d8f1db7c5b6b45c0ef0c483801420/src/settings/settings.ts#L138)). The static constant must be a string equal to the key name. The constant name must start with `SETTING_` and must be the key name capitalized and using underscores. For example if the key name is `highlight-current-window`, add this to the file:
```js
static SETTING_HIGHLIGHT_CURRENT_WINDOW = 'highlight-current-window';
```

3. Edit the file `src/keybindings.ts` by adding a new signal with a name equal to the key name. Be sure to put `Meta.Display.$gtype` followed by all the parameter types you need (if any). For example, if the key name is `highlight-current-window` and it doesn't need any parameter, add this:
```js
'highlight-current-window': {
    param_types: [Meta.Display.$gtype], // Meta.Display,
},
```

4. The idea is that, when the user presses the keybindings, the Keybinding singleton class will emit that signal. To achieve that, edit the file `src/keybindings.ts` by emitting the signal when the keybindings are used, for example [here](https://github.com/domferr/tilingshell/blob/8a1f21620d5d8f1db7c5b6b45c0ef0c483801420/src/keybindings.ts#L223). For example if the key name is `highlight-current-window`, add this:
```js
Main.wm.addKeybinding(
    Settings.SETTING_HIGHLIGHT_CURRENT_WINDOW,
    extensionSettings,
    Meta.KeyBindingFlags.NONE,
    Shell.ActionMode.NORMAL,
    (display: Meta.Display) => {
        this.emit('highlight-current-window', display);
    },
);
```
You can put after `display` all the parameters you need (if any).

5. Ensure you disable the keybindings when the extension is disabled. To achieve that edit the file `src/keybindings.ts` to remove the keybindings, for example [here](https://github.com/domferr/tilingshell/blob/8a1f21620d5d8f1db7c5b6b45c0ef0c483801420/src/keybindings.ts#L318). For example, if the key name is `highlight-current-window` then add this:
```js
Main.wm.removeKeybinding(Settings.SETTING_HIGHLIGHT_CURRENT_WINDOW);
```

6. You can now listen to the keybindings from everywhere by just connecting to the signal. A good place to do so is in the `src/extension.ts` file, for example [here](https://github.com/domferr/tilingshell/blob/8a1f21620d5d8f1db7c5b6b45c0ef0c483801420/src/extension.ts#L264). For example, if the key name is `highlight-current-window` then add this:
```js
this._signals.connect(
  this._keybindings,
  'highlight-current-window',
  (kb: KeyBindings, dp: Meta.Display) => {
      // handle the keybinding and perform the actions you want
      // to happen when the keybinding is used by the user
      ...
  },
);
```

7. Edit the file `src/prefs.ts` to allow the user to choose its preferred keybindings. This can be easily done by adding a new entry in the `keybindings` array. For example by adding a new entry [here](https://github.com/domferr/tilingshell/blob/8a1f21620d5d8f1db7c5b6b45c0ef0c483801420/src/prefs.ts#L639). For example, if the key name is `highlight-current-window` then add this:
```js
[
    Settings.SETTING_HIGHLIGHT_CURRENT_WINDOW,
    _('Highlight focused window'),
    _('Minimize all the other windows and show only the focused window'),
    false,
    false,
],
```
The first element is the settings key, the second element is the title and the third is the description. The fourth is a boolean used by the preferences to store if that setting is set or not. The last is a boolean that indicates whether or not this setting must be on the main page, otherwise it can be accessed by expanding the list of available keybindings. However, any keybinding set by the user is always put on the main page.
_Please use the same description you wrote in the schema at step 1._
